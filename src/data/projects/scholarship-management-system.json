  "longDescription": "The manual, paper-based scholarship application process at educational institutions is often inefficient, prone to errors, and lacks transparency for both students and administrators. Students struggle to track their application status, while administrators are burdened with manual processing and review. This project aimed to create a centralized, digital platform to solve these issues. I developed a comprehensive, full-stack platform using Next.js to fully digitize and streamline the scholarship lifecycle. This system addresses the needs of both students applying for financial aid and administrators managing the programs. Key features include a secure user authentication system, an intuitive multi-step application form for students, a dedicated portal for administrators to review and approve applications, and automated email notifications to keep all parties informed. The project significantly enhances efficiency and accessibility, replacing a manual, paper-based process."
