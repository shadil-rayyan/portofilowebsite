  "longDescription": "Developed a comprehensive, full-stack platform using Next.js to fully digitize and streamline the scholarship lifecycle. This system addresses the needs of both students applying for financial aid and administrators managing the programs. Key features include a secure user authentication system, an intuitive multi-step application form for students, a dedicated portal for administrators to review and approve applications, and automated email notifications to keep all parties informed. The project significantly enhances efficiency and accessibility, replacing a manual, paper-based process."
