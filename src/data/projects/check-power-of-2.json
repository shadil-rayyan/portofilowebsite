  "longDescription": "In many computational tasks, especially in algorithms and low-level programming, determining if a number is a power of 2 is a frequent requirement. Standard approaches can be inefficient, so I created a lightweight and optimized NPM package to solve this problem. Built with performance in mind, it uses bitwise operations to provide an instantaneous result, making it ideal for algorithms, game development, or any application where performance is critical. The package is published on the NPM registry, is fully documented, and includes unit tests to ensure reliability, providing a simple yet powerful utility for any Node.js developer's toolkit."
