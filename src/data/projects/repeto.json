  "longDescription": "Students and professionals often miss out on valuable career-building opportunities like scholarships, hackathons, and internships because the information is scattered across numerous websites and difficult to track. The problem is a lack of a single, reliable platform for discovery and management. To solve this, I built Repeto, a dynamic web platform that aggregates recurring opportunities into a single, searchable database. Built on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), Repeto allows users to filter opportunities by category, eligibility, and deadlines. Key features include personalized email notifications for saved searches and a user dashboard to manage applications, empowering users to stay organized and never miss an important deadline."
