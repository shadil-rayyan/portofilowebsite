  "longDescription": "As a participant in the StackUp challenge hosted by TinkerHub, I identified the need for a modern, fast, and user-friendly platform for food enthusiasts to share their culinary passion. I developed a full-featured food blog platform from the ground up using Next.js for a fast, server-rendered frontend. Key features include a rich text editor for writing and formatting recipes and stories, beautiful image galleries to showcase creations, and social sharing capabilities to engage with a wider audience. The project demonstrates skills in full-stack web development, UI/UX design, and creating community-focused applications."
