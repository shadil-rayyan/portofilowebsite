  "longDescription": "As a participant in the StackUp challenge hosted by TinkerHub, I developed a full-featured food blog platform from the ground up. Built using Next.js for a fast, server-rendered frontend, this website allows food enthusiasts to share their culinary passion. Key features include a rich text editor for writing and formatting recipes and stories, beautiful image galleries to showcase their creations, and social sharing capabilities to engage with a wider audience. The project demonstrates skills in full-stack web development, UI/UX design, and creating community-focused applications."
