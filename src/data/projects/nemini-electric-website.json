  "longDescription": "Local service-based businesses often lack a professional online presence, which limits their ability to attract and inform potential customers. This project involved creating a professional website for Nemini Electric, a local electrical services company. I customized a modern, responsive HTML and CSS template to match the company's branding and business needs. The resulting static website effectively showcases their range of services, features a gallery of past work, and includes a clear contact section with a map and inquiry form. This project improved the company's visibility and provided a professional digital storefront."
