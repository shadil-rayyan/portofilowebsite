  "longDescription": "The market for laptops is complex, with prices varying widely based on a multitude of technical specifications. This project aimed to demystify laptop pricing by building a predictive model. Following a detailed tutorial, I built a machine learning model to predict the price of laptops. This project was a hands-on exercise in the end-to-end data science workflow, involving data collection, extensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, and training several regression models. The final model is deployed in a user-friendly web application using Streamlit, where a user can input laptop specifications and receive an estimated price."
